autocmt
=======

I hate documentation boxes for my programming assignments.

This will insert them in no time at all!

**Usage:**

    autocmt.py [-o] sourcefile.cpp
    
An invocation with a source file as a single argument will write its contents to standard output with documentation boxes appended. The option *-o* will modify the file in place.

**Requires**: Clang and it's bindings for Python.

**Warning:** *"Works on my machine"*
